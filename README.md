# hono-worker

## Note
I wanna create static site in cloudflare worker, therefore I adopted [hono](https://hono.dev/) framework, more specifically using [honox](https://github.com/honojs/honox) of `xbasic` model. ~~At last, I am going to rewrite [kishax-web](https://github.com/verazza/kishax-web) with hono.~~ Abandoned cuz kishax-web's express.js implementation is too huge.

## Deploy
- cloudflare
